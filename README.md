 This is the final report for a robotics project I worked with Luis Calyeca in a Caltech course called Me 8: Introduction to Robotics. We developed and constructed a gimbal with two rotating motors and a camera in order to autonomously detect and track objects by focusing on their color using OpenCV software and multiple threads. At the end of the report document, you can find the code we wrote to control the gimbal.
